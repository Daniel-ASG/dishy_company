# 1. Business problem
The company Dishy is a marketplace for restaurants. Their core business is to facilitate meetings and negotiations between customers and restaurants. Restaurants register on Dishy's platform, which provides information such as address, type of cuisine served, whether they have reservations, whether they make deliveries, and also a rating of the restaurant's services and products, among other information.

The CEO was recently hired and needs to understand the business better in order to make the best strategic decisions and leverage Dishy even more, and for this, he needs an analysis to be done on the company's data and dashboards to be generated. He would like to see the following metrics:

### On Overview:
  1. The number of restaurants.
  2. In how many countries the company operates.
  3. How many cities it serves.
  4. How many evaluations have been performed.
  5. The number of different types of cuisines on the platform.
  6. The geographical distribution of all restaurants.
### On the Countries View:
  1. Number of registered cities per country.
  2. Number of registered restaurants per country.
  3. Number of cuisines per country.
  4. Number of evaluations per country.
  5. Avg Number of reviews per country.
  6. Avg score per country.
  7. Countries & Price types distribution.
### On the Cities View:
  1. Number of registered restaurants per city.
  2. Number of registered cuisines per city.
  3. Average restaurants ratings per city.
### On the Restaurants View:
  1. How many restaurants are delivering now.
  2. How many restaurants have table booking.
  3. The number of restaurants that have online delivery.
  4. The name of the most expensive dish for two restaurants.
  5. Average cost for two per rating.
  6. Top 15 Restaurants (by ratings & votes).
  7. Average cost for two (US$) by cuisines.
  8. Cuisines diversity distribution.

The goal of this project is to create a set of charts and/or tables that display these metrics in the best possible way for the CEO.

# 2. Assumptions made for the analysis
  1. All currencies have been converted to the US dollar to make comparisons easier.
  2. Marketplace was the business model assumed.
  3. The 3 main business views were: Countries view, Cities view and Restaurants view.

# 3. Solution Strategy
The strategy dashboard was developed using the metrics that reflect the main business model views of the company.

# 4. Top 3 Data Insights
1. The big market is in India, with almost 45% of the number of restaurants.
2. Restaurants that receive many reviews will often have a higher rating. It is worth investing in requesting that customers rate the service.
3. The market in the American continent has potential but is still very little explored.
4. Knowing what kind of cuisine is preferred by users in each country and city will help improve Dishy's growth strategies.

# 5. the final product of the project

# 6. Conclusion
The goal of this project was to create a set of charts and/or tables that display these metrics in the best possible way for the CEO.
Since many regions are still unserved, there is great potential for growth of the platform in the coming years.

# 7. Next steps
1. Detail some analysis regarding cuisines types.
2. Deepen the analyses regarding the evaluations provided.

4. Add new business views.
5. Develop Machine Learning Models that can help the company improve its performance.
